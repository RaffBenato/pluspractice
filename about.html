      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I built this web application when my son was working towards his Eleven
        Plus Exams and it has been essential in his academic success. I decided
        to release as a public web site so that other kids can benefit from it.
        Although in his case it was used as a studying tool for the exams
        specifically, I have modified the application so that it doesn't have to
        be used for that particular objective. I believe that any child of
        primary school age can benefit from using this website to achieve
        academic improvements. The website is purposely built without the usual
        gimmicky colours, sounds and characters as it is my belief that children
        benefit from separating playing time from working time. With the usual
        apps/website developed for kids with the idea of "learning through
        play", the child is left to spend hours with a device. The though is
        that the child will learn as they kill time with the games but in
        reality the child will normally get distracted by the richness of the
        digital experience and not focus on the work. Children will benefit from
        short, focused work time. It doesn't have to take much of their time, 10
        minutes daily should be enough to see real improvement in their academic
        abilities. If your goal is to prepare your child for the Eleven Plus
        Exams then I recommend using this application on top of some of the
        books we recommend in our Materials section. I do not sell any of the
        materials listed there but as an affiliate I may receive a small
        percentage from Amazon.(This will not incur you any further cost so if
        you can, please use the links provided to support the website). I will
        be adding new activities whenever possible, please get in touch if you
        have any suggestions or need help with anything.
