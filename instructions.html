      <p>
        The way I advise you to use this web application is by asking the child
        to practice between 5 and 10 minutes daily. The app is made so that is
        better viewed and used on a mobile device. This is not supposed to be
        viewed by the child as a game or a way to spend time but as a focused
        activity to support their learning, just like homework would be. You can
        agree a target for each activity. For example you may ask them to work
        on their addition activity until they can get a result of 20 correct
        answers without any mistakes. They should work towards that target
        every, if the activity has levels the child can then move on to the next
        level once they have hit the agreed target. This is up to you and your
        child but you should choose a challenging level for every session. These
        sessions should be short but intense. There are no specific order in
        which to use the application.
